   <h3>Cancer is a condition in which some cells in the body grow out of control and spread to other parts of the body.
   Cancer can begin practically anywhere in the trillions of cells that make up the human body. Human cells normally expand and multiply (via a process known as cell division) to generate new cells as needed by the body. Cells die as they become old or injured, and new cells replace them.
   Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldnâ€™t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign). 
   Cancerous tumours can infect adjacent tissues and spread to other parts of the body, resulting in the formation of new tumours (a process called metastasis). Malignant tumours are another name for cancerous tumours. Many malignancies, including leukemias, create solid tumours, whereas cancers of the blood do not.
   Benign tumours do not penetrate or spread into neighbouring tissues. Benign tumours rarely reappear after being excised, although malignant tumours do. However, benign tumours can grow to be extremely enormous. Some, such as benign brain tumours, can produce serious symptoms or even be fatal.

    <section><p>You are more likely to get <a data-crosslink-type="article" 
      href="https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm" data-metrics-link="">cancer</a> 
      as you get older. In fact, age is the biggest risk factor for the disease. More than nine out of 10 cancers are diagnosed in people 45 and older. Seniors older than 74 make up almost 28% of all new cancer cases.</p>
      <p>Researchers are not sure why this is so. It could be that the passing decades give your cells more time to turn faulty, or mutate, and grow into cancer. Or older age simply means you have been exposed to sunlight, cigarette smoke, chemicals, and other cancer-causing agents for longer.</p>
    </section>
    <section> <p>An estimated 1.81 million people in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2020. About 606,000 people are expected to die from any type of cancer. Cancer death rates have improved steadily since the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>About four out of 10 Americans will have cancer at some point in their lifetime.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div><h2>Cases by Age Groups</h2><p>You can get cancer at any age, including as infants and toddlers. But cancer is mostly a disease of middle age and beyond. The median age at diagnosis is 66, meaning that half of all new cases are found before then and half are diagnosed later. </p>
      <p>The following is the share of diagnoses for all types of cancer in the U.S. by age groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Under 20:</strong> 1%</li>
        <li><strong>20-34:</strong> 3%</li>
        <li><strong>35-44:</strong> 5%</li>
        <li><strong>45-54:</strong> 14%</li>
        <li><strong>55-64:</strong> 24%</li>
        <li><strong>65-74:</strong> 25%</li>
        <li><strong>75-84:</strong> 20%</li>
        <li><strong>85 and over:</strong> 8%</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>In the United States in 2018, 1,708,921 new cancer cases were reported and 599,265 people died of cancer. For every 100,000 people, 436 new cancer cases were reported and 149 people died of cancer. 2018 is the latest year for which incidence data are available.</strong></p>
        <p>The <a href="/cancer/uscs/">United States Cancer Statistics</a> (USCS) are the official federal cancer statistics. They come from combined cancer registry data collected by CDC's <a href="/cancer/npcr/">National Program of Cancer Registries</a> and the National Cancer Institute's

          <span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </a>&nbsp;These data are used to understand cancer burden and trends, support cancer research, measure progress in cancer control and prevention efforts, target action on eliminating disparities, and improve cancer outcomes for all.</p>
